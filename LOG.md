No progress. Dynamixel shield doesn't make the servo moved a single degree. I'm frustrated.

- Talk to lecturer for the possibilities of title change. Prefer back to old title, "Internet of Things" than "Deep Learning". One lecturer said to just go on with "Deep Learning".
- There's contact with customer support Digiware. They gave me a document and tutorial regarding the dynamixel shield.
- Buy USB TTL on Tokopedia. We will se later.
