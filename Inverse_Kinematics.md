# Inverse Kinematics

## Definition:
Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the cause of the motion, such as forces and torques. Inverse kinematics is the use of kinematic equations to determine the motion of a robot to reach a desired position ([Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/inverse-kinematics.html#:~:text=Inverse%20kinematics%20is%20the%20use,between%20bins%20and%20manufacturing%20machines), Year Unknown).
